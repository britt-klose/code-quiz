# code-quiz
Description of the project:

This project entails encoding a webpage (using HTML, JS and Web APIs, and CSS)that presents a user with a timed quiz. The quiz is made up of 20 multiple choice questions about Java Script basics and using Web APIs in Java Script. As soon as the user hits 'begin', the timer begins and the user is presented with the first question. 

The user is only able to see one question at a time, and are unable to move backward once a question has been answered. As soon as the user selects an answer choice they are shown the next question. If they answer a question incorrectly, 5 seconds is subtrated from the timer; which will be displayed to the user on the timer. The quiz will end when the time has run out, or the user has finished the quiz. Afterwards the user can then save their initials and their score. The highest scores will be stored so a user can compare their progress to other students.
